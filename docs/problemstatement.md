📌 Project Title:
Agentic AI Tools for Marketing Automation & Content Creation

🚦 Stage:
MVP Test Phase (not a polished SaaS — focus on functionality over UI)

🎯 Audience:
Builders, developers, AI solution designers — tech partners capable of delivering
intelligent, agentic workflows.

🎯 Purpose:
To automate and enhance marketing workflows using agentic AI — freeing up
marketers to focus on strategy, while AI agents handle content, creative, and setup.

🔧 This is for:
• Internal use: Marketing agency runs multiple client campaigns with less manual effort.
• External use: Tools can be licensed to clients — modular, brand-adaptable, and easy to use.

🤖 What’s Being Built (2 Agents):

1. Marketing Automation Agent
   • Input: Prompt like “Build a 7-email + 2-SMS cart abandonment sequence for X brand.”
   • Output:
     - Email/SMS sequences with copy, visuals, structure
     - Campaign set up in Klaviyo (or similar) and ready to launch
     - Editable via chat (e.g., “Change email 3 to focus on urgency”)
     - Auto-generated based on brand website, funnel, and best practices
     - Modular (mix welcome flows, winbacks, etc.)

2. Content Generation Agent
   • Input: Prompt like “Launching a new Gen-Z matcha drink — create ad content.”
   • Output:
     - Ad copy (headline, CTA, etc.)
     - Social captions (Instagram, TikTok)
     - Product visuals via AI tools
     - UGC video scripts and edited short-form videos (via Opus Clip, Captions)
     - Email creative assets
     - Rich media formats like quizzes, expandable banners, gamified ads
     - Chat-editable content (revise tone, add urgency, etc.)

⚙️ System Requirements:
• Agentic: System performs entire task from input to platform integration (e.g., Klaviyo)
• Modular: One system for multiple brands — not hardcoded per client
• Adaptive: Understands brand/product from URL or prompt
• Reusable & Scalable: Same system deployable across clients with minimal changes
• Built using integrations: LangChain, ChatGPT API, Zapier, Klaviyo, Opus Clip, RunwayML, etc.
• Editable & Transparent: High-quality output, clear logic, flexible models
• Containerized: Can be deployed in isolated environments

📌 Expected From You (Proposal Must Include):
1. Your approach/methodology
2. Phased agile development plan
3. Time estimates
4. Financial forecast/sprint-based cost
5. Clarifying questions for them
6. Recommended tech stack
